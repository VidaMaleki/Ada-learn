'''
Your goal is to write a function that determines who has visited the most restaurants. You will be given a dictionary that records restaurant visits, such as the example below:

visits = {
    "Spicy City" : ["Auberon", "Elora"],
    "La Especial Norte": ["Elora", "Auberon", "Rowan"],
    "Sushi Kashiba": ["Xinting", "Aisha", "Xinting"],
    "Lyon's Grocery": ["Auberon", "Xinting", "Sam", "Xinting"],
    "Applebee's": ["Sam", "Eliza"],
}

Each key holds the name of a restaurant, and the value is a list of restaurants visits. Each visit is represented as a string holding the name of the person who visited. Note that a person may visit the same restaurant multiple times.

In this example, Auberon has visited three different restaurants: Spicy City, La Especial Norte, and Lyon's Grocery. This is more different restaurants than anyone else in the dictionary.

Write a function that accepts a dictionary of restaurant visits and returns the name of the person who visited the most different restaurants. See assertions below for more test cases.

    #   key will be person, value will be how many

    for visitors in visits.values():

                unique_visit_count[visitor] = 1

                unique_visit_count[visitor] += 1

        if most_visits is None or count > most_visits:
            most_visits = count
            best_visitor = visitor

    return best_visitor

    "Spicy City" : ["Elora", "Elora", "Elora"],
}

***NOTES TO INTERVIEWER***

---------Answers to clarifying questions----------
Q: What should I do if there is a tie?
A: You can assume there will not be a tie.

Q: What should I do if invalid input is passed in?
A: You can assume that the input will be valid.

Q: What should If there are no visitors in the input?
A: You can assume that at least one person will visit at least one restaurant.

Q: Does capitalization matter?
A: Yes, you the input is case-sensitive. You code should treat "Auberon" and "AUBERON" as two different people.

Q: Are these restaurants any good?
A: Yes, they're all excellent. In particular, definitely go to La Especial Norte if you're ever in San Diego.

--------------------------------------------------



---------Hints for struggling candidates----------

 - If your candidate struggles with an initial algorithm, encourage them to walk through an example and desrcibe how they would do it using only pen and paper

 - If your candidate's code is returning "Xinting" for the second test case, remind them that a person may visit a restaurant multiple times, but we're interested in the number of *different* restaurants a person visits. (Xinting only visits two different restaurants, Auberon visits three)
