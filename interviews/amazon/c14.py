# "Short technical questions
# 1. write a methods to determine whether the string had characters in it
# 2. write a method to take out the nil out of an array
# 3. call an instance method â€”> create a class and write an instance method ( be able to have that method take a parameter)
# 4. how to call it without making a new instance of the class.
# 5. how to see all the methods available for a certain object "
# "Imagine you have a list of customers that has a list of jobs. Write a function to determine if any two two customers share the same job (and thus would benefit from caching)
#  (Returns true/false)"
# "1. Given an array of integers, return a palindrome of each integer   2. Write a function which takes a input of a string of sentence, reverse the words inside the sentence   # e.g. Input: Today is sunny Friday   # Output: Friday sunny is Today
# # assume there is one space between each word
# # Input: """"
# # Output: """"

# Given an array of numbers, return the average of these numbers. Follow up: how would you scale this for an infinate array of numbers?
# Write a function that takes an array of sorted integers (eg. [1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11]) and outputs a string of the ranges (eg. "1-3,5,7,9-11")
# Amazon is having a site-wide sale; everything is 20% off. Can you write me a function that takes a sentence found on the Amazon retail website, discounts the price if there is a price present, and finally returns the modified sentence. Example: "Amazon Echos are $50 today." > "Amazon Echos are $40 today." Assumptions: 1. there are no typos in the input sentence 2. you can use existing built-in functions to convert from strings to floats and vice versa (256.0).to_s # => "256.0" '3.14'.to_f => 3.14
# "given a list of stock prices, what is the maximum product you can make from one buy-sell transaction
