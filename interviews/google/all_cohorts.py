# "Given a time as input in 12 hour style. Return new time in fewest button pushes. 

# Use the following methods:
# Clock.changeHour() - which increments clock by an hour
# Clock.change1Min() - which increments clock by 1 minutes
# Clock.change5Min() - which increments clock by 5 minutes
# Clock.change15Min() - which increments clock by 15 minutes

# Input [ HH, MM, 12/24 ]  -> can't remember actual formatting, but it was some sort of list. 

# Those Clock.change methods are considered provided already.
# There is no output, you just perform the function with the fewest button pushes. 
# The time that you are changing input time to is current time in my example, but it wasn't specified in problem. 

# I think the problem was worded in such a way as to inspire many questions.  "

# "Ruby Linter 
# Write a method to check if the array of strings (each element represent a line in the codefile) follows proper linting rules (before a class declaration, there must be a comment). Return true or false
# Example input:
# [""# this class does this"",
# ""class Foo"",
# "" "",
# ""end"",
# "" "",
# ""class Car"",
# ""# comment"",
# ""end""]  => false because before the Car class declaration, there's no comment"







# "You're given two strings, j and s.  String j represents the types of stones that are jewels, and string s representing the stones you have.  Each character in string s is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# Example 1:
# Input: j = ""aA""; s = ""aAAbbbb""
# Output: 3
# Example 2:
# Input: j = ""z""; s = ""ZZ""
# Output: 0"






# "  given a 1-word string, and a multi-word string, return T/F on whether their patterns match. ex: ""abba"" vs ""cat dog dog cat"" => true
#   ex: ""abab"" vs ""cat dog cat cat"" => false"







# Triangle sorted array is defined as an array of integers, with no duplicates, ascending once first and then descending once (assume no nil input): e.g. [1, 3, 2] is one, [1, 3, 2, 3] is not. 1). Find the min value of a triangle sorted array; 2). Determine if an input array of integers is a triangle sorted array. 








# "1) Remove duplicates from sorted array.
# 2) What if the array is not sorted and you want to return unique elements
# 3) What if the user of the method removeDuplicates does not know the array needs to be sorted, what will you do?
# 4) What if the array is not sorted, have duplicates and
# you want to return top K elements        "






# Pretend Google needs to improve its search results. Pretend for a search term, such as "funny cat", we have a list of URLs. Write a method that returns the most popular URL.







# "Two timed questions: 
# 1. Given an array of integers, return an array of numbers with the largest contiguous sum eg [10, -1, -5, 8, 12] returns [8, 12], [-1, 5] returns [5], and 0, 12, -14, -6, 7, 15, -1] returns [-6, 7, 15, -1]
# // This looks like a mistake, correct outputs should be [10, -1, -5, 8, 12] , [5], [7,15]
# 2. How would you design a parking lot? You have spaces for oversize vehicles, compact vehicles, and motorcycles. You need to be able to tell if a spot is occupied and if the lot is full. (Expected to ask clarifying questions and show the rough structure of what classes/data/methods you might need.)"

# Vending machine: write a method to calculate correct change for a purchase and return how much of each coin should be given back. Preference is given to return the fewest coins (e.g. return a quarter instead of 25 pennies). You have unlimited amounts of currency of each denomination.







# Given the input of two numbers, hour and minute, calculate the angle of analog clock. Return a positive number if the hour hand is ahead of the minute hand and negative in the opposite case.
