#Imagine working on software that deals with restaurant reviews.
#Create a function named get_highest_rated that is responsible for finding the highest-rated restaurant.
#This function should take in a list of dictionaries named restaurants as a parameter.
# Each dictionary represents the data associated with a restaurant, including its rating. 
# This function should have a return value of the restaurant with the highest rating.
